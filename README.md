# UFOs

## Purpose:
The objective of this project was to create a webpage that allowed the user to filter a table of UFO data based off of 5 serach criteria: Date, Country, State, City, and Shape.  The webpage also provided the user with a informative post from the author of the page herself.

## How to use the page:
The webpage is designed to allow users to filter the UFO table by various factors they might be interested in.  Once the user makes a selection in one of the filters, the table will automatically update to show only the results that match the users input as seen [here](https://github.com/kowiak89/UFOs/blob/main/images/filterbox.pdf).  If at anytime the user wishes to reset the filters they may delete the existing filters or click [here](https://github.com/kowiak89/UFOs/blob/main/images/pagereload.pdf) to reload the page.

## Improvements:
I think the webpage is a great start at providing people with UFO information. There are some improvements that I think would make the site even better though.  Dana could add a section for UFO article links so she could share more information with her readers.  We could then apply a similar filter so that people could search for articles by date or title.  Another improvement would be to increase the data displayed in the table.  By providing images or videos with the description Dana could really bring to life the experinces of these sightings.  It would even be cool if her readers could upload their own encounters to spread the word even faster!
